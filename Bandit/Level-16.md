# Level 16: Bandit - OverTheWire

**🎯Objective:**  
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First, find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then, find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. Only one server will provide the next credentials; the others will return whatever is sent to them.
